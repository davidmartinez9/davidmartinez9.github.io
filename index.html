	<p>I decided to learn about programming because I enjoy learning new things and I enjoy challenging myself. Programming seems very interesting and useful and I look forward to learning more and more.
	</p>
	<p>Some of my hobbies include playing Basketball, working out, taking my dogs out, going to church and attending sporting events. I also love new experiences. Meeting new people, new places, new restaurants. I try to enjoy every moment and grow every day.</p>
